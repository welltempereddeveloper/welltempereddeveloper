You may have heard of [YAGNI][yagni]. People have written about it
[over][yagni-1], and [over][yagni-2], and [over][yagni-3], and [over][yagni-4],
and [over][yagni-5] again.

I'm not here to repeat what that's about. I'm just here to say, "Seriously, you
aren't gonna need it."

Features, optimizations, parallelization, overloaded functions, code branches,
optional parameters, libraries that do this and that, scripts that handle all
theoretically-possible scenarios...just stop.  You really, really ain't gonna
need it.

You wanna know what you _are_ gonna need that you probably should be working on
instead? Take a look at your backlog. _Those_ are the things that you're gonna
need. So finish up whatever you're working on, get it shipped, get it
operating, and move on.
