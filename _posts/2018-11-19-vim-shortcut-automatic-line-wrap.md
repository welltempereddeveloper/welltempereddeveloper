Shortcuts make the world go round.

Well, not really. But they sure help get things done. They _help_, to a certain
extent, get easy and mundane things out of the way so that you focus on more
interesting problems.

Writing this blog, one shortcut that I reach for all the time is `gq`. I'll also
reach for this shortcut when I'm writing a helpful commit message.

### What does it do?

As succinctly as I can describe it, `gq` will "insert hard wraps", "auto line
wrap", "format paragraph", or something along those linesâ€“_yes, pun intended,
big time_. It essentially takes a paragraph and makes sure that no line is
longer than 80 characters. For lines that are less than 80 characters, `gq` will
steal a word or two (or as many as necessary) from the lines _below_ it, and
tack them onto the end of the current line in order to get that line as close
as possible to 80 characters.

If you have `textwidth` set to some number, then it'll use that value instead
of 80. You can, for example, `set textwidth=40` in your current session or in
your `~/.vimrc` and always force wrapping at 40 characters max.

### See it in action

Go ahead and type out a super-long line. Highlight the line (using `shift+v`)
and then type `gq` to se the wrap happen. Works like a charm.

A variation of this, if you want to avoid highlighting, is `gq}`. Since `}` is
just a motion that means "to-end-of-paragraph", vim will wrap starting from the
cursor position all the way to the end of the paragraph. No pre-highlighting
required.

Either way, whatever floats your boat, just know that `gq` is a thing and works
quite well for those cases when you need those hard line breaks, but just don't
want to do them yourself. Enjoy!
