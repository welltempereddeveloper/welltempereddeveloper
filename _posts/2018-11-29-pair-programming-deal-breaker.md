Pair programming is great. Productivity increases. The quality of work goes up.
Distractions go down.

That's with that caveat, that it is done correctly.

Yes, it can be, and oftentimes is, done incorrectly. There are _lots_ of things
that can ruin a pair programming session. Let's talk about one of them.

## Sharing the Workspace

This is a big offender and a deal breaker.

Two people decide to pair on a problem. Let's call them Tom and Jerry. There are no
dedicated pairing stations available, so they decide to pair at Tom's desk.

Tom is used to working alone. In fact, he almost always works alone. When Jerry
swings by to pair for a little bit, Tom is all cozy and ready to work. In fact,
he's so comfortable that he doesn't actually do anything to help Jerry get
situated in. Tom still feels as if he's working alone. He doesn't even _move
over_ to allow Jerry to squeeze in a bit closer for a comfortable look at the
monitor.

### So how does Jerry feel?

Terrible.

For starters, he's 5 feet away from the monitor. He's probably leaning forward
just to get a glimpse at the monitor and attempt to read the 10-point font that
Tom has configured on his editor.

He's also in a new physical area of the office, at a workstation where someone
_else_ always sits and works. From his position, there is Jerry can't even
fathom to get his hands on the keyboard.

### That's not pairing and Jerry is not feeling welcome.

If Tom is hosting the pairing session at his station, then Tom should make
Jerry feel welcome. For starters, Tom should move over and make room for Jerry
at the workstation. That's a must. No exceptions.

Both of them should be able to comfortably see what's on the monitor. Ideally,
they have two mirrored monitors. It's 2018 and monitors are not that expensive.
Ditto with the keyboard.

Comfort is essential. And I'm not talking about La-Z-Boy recliners and foot
massages. But if one person does not feel comfortable pairing, for any
reason, then they will try it once, maybe twice or three times, and that'll be
it.

In order for pairing to be effective, people must feel as comfortable pairing as
they do working alone. Make that happen. Spot when it's not happening and fix
it.
